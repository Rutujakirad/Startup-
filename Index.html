<p>The incredible beauty of wildlife animals and why we love them so much… The beauty of wildlife animals is amazing…. Not only visually, but the very fact that animals still live FREE is exhilarating.

<h3>The incredible beauty of wildlife animals and why we love them so much</h3>
<p> The beauty of wildlife animals is amazing…. Not only visually, but the very fact that animals still live FREE is exhilarating. When I heard there are hundreds of wild deer and other wildlife animals in a huge nature reserve close to our home, my response was like that form a little child. Really? Wild deer? Like ‘wild’? Being a real city boy, I was thrilled to the depth of my toes… I always longed to live near wildlife animals!</p>
<h3>Unexpected new haven for wildlife animals</h3>
<p>It is quite amazing how this wildlife reserve came about, since it originally was destined to be a huge industrial area. The Dutch had drained a large part of the sea (can you believe it?), to create more land for themselves. Incredible! A vast area was set apart to become a horrible hell of industry and pollution, ruining the landscapes and the environment. But… nature decided otherwise. Water kept coming up from the ground and the engineers weren’t able to keep the soil dry, so they abandoned it for a few years. Here you see a wildlife phot I made of a stunning wife heron taking off to flight.</p>
